Welcome to Japaniku! This blog's purpose is to share my Japan adventures, and also help you start your own Japan adventures!

I've lived in 6 different places in Japan, and consider myself a seasoned traveler of the Land of the Rising Sun. All photography and other content is my original work. Also, I never use any filters or lighting magic, so what you see is what you get.

Enjoy!
